# Indoor Proximity-based Advertising using Bluetooth Beacons
Bluetooth is a perfect alternative technology for indoor localisation
and is highly accurate, cost-effective, can be installed with minimal
effort, and supported by many operating systems and devices. Indoor
localisation proposes an immense value proposition to retails
stores. In this paper, an indoor localisation prototype is built based
on Bluetooth beaconsâ€™ signals. The accuracy of the prototype is
evaluated to determine its possible real-world applications, such as
location-based advertisements in a shopping mall or supermarket
environment.
